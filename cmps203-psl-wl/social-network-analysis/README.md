### Social Network Analysis

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to predict a user's political preference given the social network that they belong to.
This is a synthetic dataset generated using power-law distributions to model typical social networks.

## Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and contains information about a user's inherent bias and six different types of relationships that
they can have with the users around them.

## Origin

This example is a simplified version of one of the experiments from Bach et al.'s core PSL paper:
"Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic":
```
@article{bach:jmlr17,
  Author = {Bach, Stephen H. and Broecheler, Matthias and Huang, Bert and Getoor, Lise},
  Journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)},
  Title = {Hinge-Loss {M}arkov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic},
  Year = {2017}
}
```
