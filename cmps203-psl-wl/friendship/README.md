### Friendship

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to predict the degree of friendship between two users.
This is a synthetic dataset that is meant to showcase two things: transitivity and blocking.

## Dataset

The dataset is synthetic and contains information about the location of individuals and whether they live in the same location.
The location information is used to block users (we only consider friendship when two people are in the same location).

## Keywords

 - `blocking`
 - `cli`
 - `evaluation`
